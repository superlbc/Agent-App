This solution will allow a streamlined process of data aggregation and provide a centralized location for all the connected data.External system integration will be covered for campaigns and events via Brandscopic, QR code via QR Tiger and Surveys via Qualtrics Surveys.Events created or updated in UET will reflect in Brandscopic.  If Brandscopic has any updates, data will be reverse synchronised to UET. Both systems will be in Sync.URLs will be assigned for each event, which will be associated with QR codes. This will be generated by QR Tiger API.Surveys will be managed by Qualtrics Surveys. UET will store only the IDs of surveys if surveys are created for any event.2System Requirements:2.1 Client ManagementEvery campaign is created for a client. From a system perspective, the client is used to physically separate data collected from various external systems. There are two different roles defined in the UET application. One is an admin role which will have access to all the client information and the other will be a user-specific role which will have access to assigned client’s information only.Configuration of each Client will be done manually and will require Infrastructure assistance for creating Client specific DB tenants.For each client, the admin user can configure which external system should be integrated for the client. For release 1, the system will only support 3 external systems (Brandscopic, Qualtrics Surveys, and QR Tiger)Client data will be predefined and stored in the UET database.2.2 Campaigns ManagementUET users will be able to create, update and delete campaigns from UET Portal for any Client. Users should be able to associate Master Program, Name, type, region, logo, and status while creating the campaign.Brandscopic does not provide Campaign creation API, so the user will have to manually create it in Brandscopic.UET users will be able to manually associate the Brandscopic Campaigns in the UET system. 2.3 Events ManagementUET Users will be able to create, update and delete events to any campaign in UET Portal.For release 1, every event operation (create, update, delete) will be reflected in Brandscopic. This is controlled through a configuration at the Client level.Users will be able to add a name, date, time, venue type and address while creating the event.2.4 QR Code ManagementUET Users will be able to create QR codes in UET using URLs via integration with QR Tiger. The UET database will store QR Tiger ID, URL, and associated QR Code.Users will be able to associate multiple QR codes with each event. Users will be able to associate the same QR code to multiple events, however, only one event should be active with the same QR code.2.5 Surveys:Surveys will be managed by Qualtrics Surveys. UET will only store the IDs of surveys if surveys are created for a particular event.Users will be able to manually map surveys with the event and only one survey can be associated with one event.Importing survey responses from Qualtrics will be out of scope.2.6 Post-Event Metrics:Post-event metrics will be synced from Brandscopic to the UET database at a predefined schedule. The following attributes will be synced from Brandscopic:Impression, Photo, interactionsCustom FieldsThe count of QR code scans of each event should be synced to the UET database from QR Tiger after the event is over.Apart from the predefined schedule, users will be able to perform a sync operation from the event listing screen. Users will have the choice between syncing a specific event, or all the events associated with a campaign.3Functional Requirements:3.1 Create/Update Campaign (as per Brandscopic) Form: Users will be able to add, edit and delete campaigns.Users can delete campaigns if there are no events associated with the campaign.Users will be able to map campaigns of UET and Brandscopic manually.For now, as campaigns API is not available in Brandscopic, manual mapping should be done, and data should be stored in the UET database.Below given are the details required to create campaigns.

This will include the initial user who creates the event but will include being updated with the latest user info when the event is modified.Updated Date: The user can view the Updated-date when the user updated/created the event. This will include the initially created date but will change when the event is modified with the most recent date.3.5 Post-Event Metrics (Reverse Sync):On the event listing screen, users will be able to view data of the sync process and will be able to perform the sync process manually.A user can only conduct one operation at a time. Individual sync buttons get disabled if the user clicks the sync button to sync all of the events, and the opposite is true for individual events.Every morning at 7:00 AM, an auto-scheduler will be set up to resync data from Brandscopic to UET.There will be data displayed on the screen in overlay form from the event listing screen where all the IDs will be there including Brandscopic ID, QR Tiger ID, and Qualtrics ID with the status of this data hub. These IDs will be useful while searching data in the database of relevant systems.Completed: The sync process is completed.In-Progress: The sync process is in progress.This sync icon button will then display the following statuses: Yellow - Process has begun or the button just clicked. Green - Data successfully synchronized with the system.Black - There are no background processes active. The user can proceed by clicking, or the scheduler can run those data at a specific time.The status of the button and the icon for each event will change to yellow when the synchronization of data is ongoing.After the data has successfully synchronized with the system, the status will be green for 3 minutes. After then, it will be changed to black since Brandscopic, QR Tiger and Qualtrics may have recently updated data that may not have synchronized with this page.3.6 Add URL for QR Code:Users should be able to add URLs with QR code names and statuses from the listing screen by clicking on ‘+New QR Code’.QR Code Name: Users should be able to add a QR Code name.Required/OptionalRequiredTypeText FieldURL: Users should be able to add a URL for a particular QR Code.Required/OptionalRequiredTypeText FieldStatus: Users should be able to select status, which will indicate whether the URL is active or inactive.

Events created in UET will be automatically created in Brandscopic, and the event id from Brandscopic will be linked to the UET event id in the UET database. This will be achieved through integration with Brandscopic API using Azure Function Apps.The UET system will utilize QR Tiger APIs to create a QR code. Upon submission of the QR data, the system will automatically generate the QR code through QR Tiger and map it in the UET database. The integration with QR Tiger API will be established by using Azure Function App.The Surveys created in Qualtrics System will be mapped into the UET database. The integration with Qualtrics Survey API will be established by using Azure Function App.To import post-event metrics into the UET database, we will utilize Azure integration services. The data from Brandscopic and QR Tiger will be synced at regular intervals `\through scheduled functions and with an on-demand data sync API developed within UET. 7Data Dictionary:LQALoop qual attemptsLQSLoop qual successVZVerizonBLBusiness LeadCampaignsThe master event as per Brandscopic
