0:0:0.0 --&gt; 0:0:10.80Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)And with that, I just want to give you guys an overview. 'cause, I know that like this is probably been said before, but we'll just a refresher for everybody.0:0:11.360 --&gt; 0:0:29.680Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)So the goal here behind the uxp is obviously we know momentum has all these different event metrics. We know that we don't necessarily share out those metrics in a timely manner which really can be an issue not just internally but for our clients as well.0:0:30.820 --&gt; 0:0:35.380Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)So when we talk about the uxp, we're talking about this actual piece over here.0:0:36.860 --&gt; 0:0:37.700Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)So.0:0:39.140 --&gt; 0:1:0.980Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)We know that we have our field managers right and they're collecting field data like was the weather nice? How many people did you talk to? All of that stuff? There's other systems right there. If it's QR codes, if it's common back end registrations for Verizon, if there's like a splash event or something like that, there will be. There'll always be the all of those other systems as well.0:1:2.340 --&gt; 0:1:30.700Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)But the real goal is to start rolling all of those different data points into one central place called the Uxp. And because of that, we'll be able to give better insights. We'll be able to give Utting's team a better heads up to say, like, hey, we do have these 30 events and OK, all these events have this one. Each event has their own ID because they all have their own ID. We are able to then.0:1:33.770 --&gt; 0:1:52.290Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Join that together with the other data points like field management systems, QR codes, whatever that could be. So we're really just working towards the goal to streamline all of this data that's not necessarily streamlined or kind of collected in different ways.0:1:54.250 --&gt; 0:1:59.570Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)So this is a fancy slide just to talk about our vision, the strategy and the steps.0:2:0.810 --&gt; 0:2:3.210Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)So again, we're going to implement the system.0:2:4.970 --&gt; 0:2:15.370Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)This is really the point is to standardise these repeatable processes that we all go through, but we want to make it the same time over time. That's not to say like.0:2:16.850 --&gt; 0:2:27.650Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)We're collecting the same data time over time because we know all of our events can be individual events that have very specific activations going on, and again, that's totally fine.0:2:28.560 --&gt; 0:2:37.600Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)But all of that data, however, it's being collected, we need to have one unified system to go back to the actual event.0:2:39.360 --&gt; 0:2:43.920Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)So for today we're talking about you guys, right, business leaders.0:2:46.300 --&gt; 0:2:55.380Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)You as B LS are typically. I know for Verizon like you're the first one to know what events are upcoming, right?0:2:57.20 --&gt; 0:3:2.260Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)We want to really understand, and Alex, I know that you already got back to me with a couple.0:3:3.740 --&gt; 0:3:10.580Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Of our interview questions, which is great, but we really just want to dig into that if we can today.0:3:12.60 --&gt; 0:3:17.620Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Just know that we're trying to understand the full process. We know like things probably will be left out.0:3:18.420 --&gt; 0:3:30.940Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Well, this is one of many conversations to come, but we're really trying to understand for each of the clients, Verizon, William Grant, everybody, how this process works to set up your events.0:3:33.960 --&gt; 0:3:49.680Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)So for the overall uxp, there's lots of steps involved where we're at today is the data discovery. So what data are we capturing? What are the sources, what is the cadence of that? Is it daily, is it and weekly, whatever.0:3:50.920 --&gt; 0:4:6.680Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)What's being captured manually by the field team and if there's any opportunities to change that so they're not plugging in what the weather is, you know for an instance, can we have an API that says, oh, you gave us the address of this event, so we can.0:4:7.760 --&gt; 0:4:15.280Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Tap into what the weather was instead of asking that question. Then there's lots of other parts to this too.0:4:16.640 --&gt; 0:4:29.800Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)The UED, the data discovery Lewis is on the call. I should have done an introduction, I apologise but Lewis is the brains behind all of this architecture.0:4:31.360 --&gt; 0:4:34.600Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)When it comes to data and how that looks, he.0:4:35.840 --&gt; 0:4:39.280Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Is really understanding that from like an overall agency perspective?0:4:39.580 --&gt; 0:5:1.740Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Along with you Ting's team is of course, umm. And then we've got for Verizon specifically, Brandscopic being implemented. So that's all of the actual field data. So again, like what we're asking our field staff to collect and then getting that input into the system. So it ties together with the events that would be in the uxp.0:5:4.640 --&gt; 0:5:6.960Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)OK. Are there any questions?0:5:10.240 --&gt; 0:5:10.400Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Nope.0:5:12.180 --&gt; 0:5:12.380Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Mm hmm.0:5:10.110 --&gt; 0:5:13.590Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Was that too many words? Hi, Eric. Eric joined.0:5:15.440 --&gt; 0:5:20.600Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)OK, so let's just dive in. If you guys don't mind.0:5:21.680 --&gt; 0:5:23.840Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)I'm gonna pull up. What?0:5:25.160 --&gt; 0:5:26.280Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Alex sent.0:5:30.650 --&gt; 0:5:59.770Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yeah. And just to what the goal is also to understand what's the purpose or what has to be done, so agnostic to technology as well. And we understand that we are using different tools, but what is it that that needs to be captured and what is it required for you? What information do you need to capture? What information do you need to be able to perform your work better or to be able to report to the client or to be able to understand the performance of of the work that's being done, et cetera, so?0:6:0.150 --&gt; 0:6:11.910Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)It's also understanding what's what should be there that's not currently there or for us to be able to, to, to understand really what what the requirement is and and provide different options and to the solution.0:6:13.770 --&gt; 0:6:22.170Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Yep. OK. So let's dive in. This is gonna be very exciting. Love the energy so far.0:6:23.630 --&gt; 0:6:40.310Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)OK, so describe the current process from client requesting approving programmes to execution. So Alex, you let us know smartsheets are used as well as Google Sheets. I guess my question is does that apply to all programmes?0:6:42.630 --&gt; 0:6:43.670Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Within Verizon.0:6:42.310 --&gt; 0:6:50.350Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Yeah, I would think so. I mean, you're gonna have like obviously emails and phone calls, et cetera, but that's just like whatever.0:6:55.180 --&gt; 0:6:55.940Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Feels like it.0:6:54.960 --&gt; 0:7:3.600Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Of the Smartsheet is the internal view. Right. And then you guys translate that into a Google sheet for the client, is that right?0:7:3.850 --&gt; 0:7:4.370Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Pretty much.0:7:6.580 --&gt; 0:7:20.780Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)And what does the client request look like? Is it complete formulated once? Once they, they request us some work? Or is it a heads up originally and that's been shaped as as the weeks progress? Or how does it work?0:7:22.790 --&gt; 0:7:24.590Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)So that's an interesting question.0:7:26.190 --&gt; 0:7:46.710Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)For programme and loa like it's in scope type of an ASK, we kind of have a good good cadence on that. We plan the events, we select the events something like that. We understand what's what's in on that for an out of scope, ask something that's a little unique and again it's somewhat rare, but it happens with some frequency.0:7:48.230 --&gt; 0:7:54.190Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)We are collecting that information, you know, just any way we can get it. It's a little bit haphazard right now.0:7:54.780 --&gt; 0:7:59.300Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)So an intake form has been something that we've talked about as a a real benefit.0:8:2.730 --&gt; 0:8:3.850Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)To get us in the right.0:8:5.170 --&gt; 0:8:6.330Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)To start to shape it in the right way.0:8:7.440 --&gt; 0:8:12.480Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)And is that an an intake form for a client or intake form internally?0:8:13.680 --&gt; 0:8:17.160Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Well, it's a. It's a bit of both. You definitely need both.0:8:18.150 --&gt; 0:8:19.590Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)And this is for out of scope.0:8:20.20 --&gt; 0:8:20.220Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Mm hmm.0:8:20.810 --&gt; 0:8:21.850Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Good to call that out.0:8:22.910 --&gt; 0:8:23.150Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yeah.0:8:25.240 --&gt; 0:8:25.560Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)But.0:8:25.180 --&gt; 0:8:27.540Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)And does the intake form exist or no?0:8:29.350 --&gt; 0:8:30.510Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)OK. But.0:8:29.720 --&gt; 0:8:38.400Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)It's basically a A, A BL talking to a client saying hey like I've been around the block. Yeah, I know what? I know what you generally need to care for.0:8:46.40 --&gt; 0:8:46.240Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)OK.0:8:39.820 --&gt; 0:8:52.500Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Let's answer some questions between you and I so I can go back to my team and and get this thing rolling for you. How many banners you know, when do you need it loaded in? How long is the activation indoor outdoor?0:8:53.960 --&gt; 0:8:56.280Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Premiums, I mean just a bunch of stuff.0:8:56.820 --&gt; 0:9:3.460Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Would that be a standard, fairly standard set of questions for all the out of scope? That's yeah.0:9:2.180 --&gt; 0:9:3.580Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Yeah, yeah.0:9:7.820 --&gt; 0:9:10.620Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)And then or in scope.0:9:12.700 --&gt; 0:9:13.100Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Yep.0:9:11.80 --&gt; 0:9:20.200Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)And sorry, it says I'm talking to some techie people. What would be, and this is gonna be a, it would be sexy is if we could take that intake form.0:9:21.800 --&gt; 0:9:26.680Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Compile compile like what you need to do with it right? And then break it out into an estimate.0:9:28.200 --&gt; 0:9:41.120Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)In some ways, saying if you need 2 brand ambassadors right, you enter a rate card and then it comes to an actual like kind of just a a broad strokes understanding you know.0:9:41.930 --&gt; 0:9:53.90Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)If you said, hey, it's it's two. It's a two day event and you need 100 premiums per event. Alright, well, there's some math right there. What price point client do you want for your? For your.0:9:55.30 --&gt; 0:9:58.70Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Your premiums, there's another, you know, data point that you can do.0:10:2.100 --&gt; 0:10:2.300Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Mm hmm.0:10:2.410 --&gt; 0:10:11.50Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Codes how many QR codes do we already have? The QR codes are? Are we creating it? Does analytics need to to be involved? There are some hours that can be assumed at that point as well.0:10:12.300 --&gt; 0:10:12.500Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Mm hmm.0:10:16.680 --&gt; 0:10:17.360Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)I'm taking you.0:10:23.470 --&gt; 0:10:24.310Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)You go ahead, Joe.0:10:16.180 --&gt; 0:10:24.420Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)In in which format do do currently rate cars exist? Is that spreadsheet or are there in in vantage in theory?0:10:25.960 --&gt; 0:10:26.720Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)You're on mute.0:10:29.270 --&gt; 0:10:33.230Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)Right now we just have like a ray card for.0:10:52.350 --&gt; 0:10:52.590Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yeah.0:10:35.20 --&gt; 0:11:5.580Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)For people, right? So if it was a director at $169, you know, as we're putting a staff plant together, what we're trying to do is take a lot of the minutia out and think of the same process where most of the physical assets are around the same cost. So instead of spending 3 hours or two hours each time going, all right, they need two boundaries. Let me look that up. And they need XY and Z. And let me look that up that we have kind of like a ballpark in there. So it just almost spits out.0:11:6.20 --&gt; 0:11:24.380Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)A. You know if they need XYZ and G all right, from a drop down menu. Here you go. It's got basically a ballpark price and we can massage it from there if we have to, but at least it gives them an idea. Like right away. Like, hey, if you want to do this out of scope event, it's going to cost you 12,500.0:11:26.290 --&gt; 0:11:43.130Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)So that way it and if they say OK, great, then we can have like a junior person do the you know the ray card and an estimate and just kind of spit that out. I think right now what happens is the amount of asks that are starting to come in, it becomes a little bit of a backlog.0:11:44.490 --&gt; 0:11:47.290Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)And it just takes a lot of person power.0:11:47.970 --&gt; 0:11:48.930Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yeah, of course.0:11:52.140 --&gt; 0:11:52.340Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yeah.0:11:59.970 --&gt; 0:12:0.250Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)Yeah.0:11:53.750 --&gt; 0:12:9.630Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)I don't know if that would be for version one of the yeah uxp, but it's certainly something to take into account and so I'm involved in a in a bigger project that's part of IPG where they are trying to be able to.0:12:11.470 --&gt; 0:12:22.830Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)To roll out a platform design, A platform that can provide this type of information for yeah, for the different agencies. So I'll I'll, yeah, I'll keep you on the loop of loop on on how that's progressing as well.0:12:23.600 --&gt; 0:12:24.40Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)Beautif.0:12:26.490 --&gt; 0:12:33.330Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)So how can we help you in this conversation? What's what's, what's something that maybe in the e-mail wasn't expanded on enough?0:12:34.540 --&gt; 0:13:0.20Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Yeah, I still have questions about so smartsheets versus Google Sheets. So can you explain the process of like, hey, you were, you know, the client approached you for your programme, you gathered the information for whatever events and then is it ABL going into smartsheets and inputting all of that information, can you just talk to that a bit?0:13:0.770 --&gt; 0:13:1.810Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)That's that's correct.0:13:3.450 --&gt; 0:13:6.730Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)The the the SMARTSHEET compiles.0:13:8.290 --&gt; 0:13:10.370Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Client facing information.0:13:10.810 --&gt; 0:13:31.210Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)It compiles analytic type things that that they need to have so to track and and look at a year end review or just a a weekly review, right. And then wishful thinking. But we started out with having a lot of XP related information as as as Joe shares it now. So there's a lot of hands that, that, that build this build this thing.0:13:31.920 --&gt; 0:13:58.920Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)And we can look to it for kind of like our North Star and the Google sheet version of it, which is a master routing doc basically is just a the client version of it because we don't have access to this. Now if we could distil this down, problem solved. But we've seen firewalls and you know issues and confusion. So we just stick with what we know there. It's not that hard, it's quite literally copy copy and pasting the lines and then.0:14:0.0 --&gt; 0:14:0.760Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)That's pretty much it.0:14:1.620 --&gt; 0:14:1.700Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Mm.0:14:19.700 --&gt; 0:14:19.900Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Mm hmm.0:14:21.40 --&gt; 0:14:21.120Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Mm.0:14:1.730 --&gt; 0:14:24.90Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)And a lot of it's the anecdotal information, right, like just the the meat we go starting with the meat potatoes, right. Like what region is it? What's the dates? And then the venue name, address. So think of right, Kristen, like what we want to put into brandscopic like all of that pertinent information, but then it gets a little bit more granular as far as like.0:14:25.290 --&gt; 0:14:32.170Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)The type of messaging, right? What? What kind of market is it? And again, I think we can have this in in brandscopic too.0:14:32.550 --&gt; 0:14:41.670Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)The footprint size, like all of this stuff, we could probably I'm guesstimating migrate over to brandscopic, so it's just.0:14:44.160 --&gt; 0:14:48.360Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)And I'm not Pooh poohing on smartsheets, but it can get very convoluted.0:14:48.430 --&gt; 0:14:48.630Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Sure.0:14:49.980 --&gt; 0:14:50.860Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)Whereas.0:14:52.420 --&gt; 0:14:58.260Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)Brandscoping hopefully can take that information and if we needed to export any simple thing we can.0:15:11.540 --&gt; 0:15:12.260Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)Exactly.0:14:59.250 --&gt; 0:15:14.690Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Yeah. And then the idea would be us extracting the data that's in branscopic to put on like a power platform power view for the client to see very like top line level things.0:15:13.530 --&gt; 0:15:31.730Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)And and me and you had kind of like offlined about it last week, where if Brad's copic has a certain way, right, as almost like back in the day with Ninja, right. All the columns had to match and all the headers had to match. Like we can Frankenstein it. You know, something like this, export it and then make sure it's matching up.0:15:32.910 --&gt; 0:15:41.430Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Kristen, has anyone you talked to from the different teams, different clients, et cetera? Have they been managing a tour?0:15:42.750 --&gt; 0:15:47.110Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Programme, a programme that needs to care for every single day they have.0:15:46.800 --&gt; 0:15:57.640Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Yeah. So like William Grant is a really good example of lots of concurrent events happening at all times and they are using what did they just show us, Louis.0:16:0.260 --&gt; 0:16:3.260Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)They were using, I think it was a SharePoint list.0:16:9.740 --&gt; 0:16:9.940Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yeah.0:16:9.560 --&gt; 0:16:10.80Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Sure.0:16:3.270 --&gt; 0:16:16.830Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)A SharePoint site? Umm. So it looks a little bit more sophisticated than your smartsheet. But yeah, there very much concurrently at all times in different regions.0:16:22.310 --&gt; 0:16:22.590Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Right.0:16:23.80 --&gt; 0:16:24.40Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Is better out there.0:16:17.140 --&gt; 0:16:28.140Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)Yeah, I think smartsheets and I don't, I don't mean to disparage it like it does the job, but I think it's if we were thinking about one point O versus 2 point O, this is definitely a one point O.0:16:28.720 --&gt; 0:16:28.800Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Mm.0:16:28.360 --&gt; 0:16:40.720Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Yeah, and that's fine. I think just even having that smartsheet is a good point to start from because that's exactly what Luis needs to understand for the data points.0:16:43.820 --&gt; 0:16:44.220Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Yep.0:16:40.820 --&gt; 0:16:59.540Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Exactly. So it's it's it just structured data which is which is perfect for us. It's to understand, yeah, what what's all that data? And then just have a UI in front that it's more user friendly that only shows the relevant information at the right points and that guides you through creating the events and then being able to write information.0:17:6.900 --&gt; 0:17:7.140Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yeah.0:17:18.520 --&gt; 0:17:18.720Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Mm hmm.0:16:57.820 --&gt; 0:17:19.20Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Yeah, there's there's, there's client facing right, which would be, you know, like basically your calendar view of sorts, maybe not that view, but whatever I'm talking about, but what's important is that the branscopic or whatever platform at least important to me is it gives our associates the ability to get granular and understand.0:17:29.580 --&gt; 0:17:29.780Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Mm hmm.0:17:29.690 --&gt; 0:17:29.890Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Yeah.0:17:20.170 --&gt; 0:17:54.810Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)The flow of the tour, like where it's gonna be, how many off days do you have those types of things because every single day needs to be cared for, right? That is different from a music festival that is just a slice of time, right? This is making sure, hey, you have to travel to Detroit if you cared for that travel. Have you given them off days? Cause they've got, you know, you know, eleven straight days of auto show. So having that capability either to quickly drop in a day off or create that visual to understand that this is a different point of time.0:17:55.620 --&gt; 0:17:56.380Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Is important.0:17:57.390 --&gt; 0:18:14.750Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)Yeah, I think an important part of it too, Alex, is right now, you know, these smartsheets are really held by let's say BL and the client where the field staff that's the feet on the street we're getting, we're getting that information post right, but not through any specific system, it's basically.0:18:16.750 --&gt; 0:18:28.110Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)You know whether a text message or call like how many KPIs did you get XY and Z? So like having that into one place and then the way y'all can manipulate that down to like.0:18:28.560 --&gt; 0:18:38.480Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)All right, this zip code or this city or this group has done X through quarter one or through quarter two like as that information gets extrapolated.0:18:41.240 --&gt; 0:18:41.760Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)Also.0:18:41.800 --&gt; 0:18:45.560Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)Having one platform will again save man hours where?0:18:53.560 --&gt; 0:18:53.840Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Yeah.0:18:54.270 --&gt; 0:18:54.430Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yeah.0:18:55.250 --&gt; 0:18:56.290Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)There's there's more.0:18:47.280 --&gt; 0:18:57.360Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)Field managers will just throw everything in right? So that way it's just it's done so that way analytics is not chasing us down and chasing other people down. So it's hopefully it becomes a lot cleaner.0:18:58.150 --&gt; 0:19:31.590Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yeah. So one of one of the bigger gaps that there is with with analytics and you think's team is that there is no not always easy to find a connection between the data that's spread across a different platforms. So one of the purposes it's the, it's the of the uxp is that being able to create the entries on the different required platforms from the get go. So when we create a campaign and events that would send and create entries on the other platforms and just provide what what the ID is. So we get all the platforms linked to an ID.0:19:32.170 --&gt; 0:19:36.690Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)And therefore we can easily connect the data through reporting and that being.0:19:38.320 --&gt; 0:19:38.560Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yeah.0:19:39.950 --&gt; 0:19:40.350Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yes.0:19:36.0 --&gt; 0:19:41.320Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)So that would be kind of like an API through let's say through whatever system through power BI.0:19:53.690 --&gt; 0:19:54.330Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)Oh wow.0:19:42.500 --&gt; 0:20:12.740Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)So initially through the UXP for example, we can create the QR codes and we can read the entries. So you could have the entry into uxp and say OK create a QR code for that event. It will create the QR code. You'll be able to see it. You'll be able to see this comes from there. But all this is is stored in a database so that can then be read by Power BI. So we can have a set of a subset of of reports for for clients with different views that are reading into the same data. For us it's important that to create those connections.0:20:12.850 --&gt; 0:20:25.250Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)So then that QR code, it's connecting to a specific event or a set of events and an entry in branch scoping as well, and the entry in the different systems that we can and, and that's one of the aims that we have for the uxp.0:20:32.680 --&gt; 0:20:33.0Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Mm hmm mm.0:20:49.100 --&gt; 0:20:49.300Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yeah.0:20:25.810 --&gt; 0:20:50.810Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)I that's phenomenal because and not to disparage you know, anyone on our team. But you know, sometimes it falls through the cracks because we have to go. All right. Hey, we need AQR code. All right, we're going to go through this Google form and then we need a URL. We're going to go through this Google form. And sometimes in the midst of everyone being busy, it becomes, oh, shoot. I didn't do that. So if that's automatically going to get done, that is, to me, a game changer.0:20:51.90 --&gt; 0:21:21.610Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yeah, yeah. And and and for the reporting. So for the data team as well because at the moment it's a manual task and sometimes to to match up that they have to check the date ranges and the location where something happened to Machito to the information that comes from from the QR Codes API, we're also able to standardise addresses for example. So we can, we can use Bing Maps or Google Maps and start typing an address and have a standard address. So it's not just a text, but it understands what's what's.0:21:20.980 --&gt; 0:21:21.660Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)Oh wow.0:21:22.260 --&gt; 0:21:49.660Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)The state was the city was the the name of the place, the the address, and those become separate fields automatically. So we can check, you know, things that happens on a specific location and events that happen on the same location for example or use that data for for reporting in any way we want to dice it. We will be the aim is to centralised all the teams through the UXP. So so all the events that that are taking place in the meantime are are.0:21:50.220 --&gt; 0:22:2.380Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Going through the same mechanism and can be reported to through through the same to the same means and mechanism. So you can just view the stuff that's relevant to your brand, but we could just have it where.0:22:9.730 --&gt; 0:22:10.170Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)Now.0:22:4.660 --&gt; 0:22:25.700Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)It can show what other events for other for other clients are happening on the same day for example. So you can have a calendar view that shows just your stuff, or like a week view that it's more expanded with. You know not only the name of the event, but any information that would need that would be helpful for you to be able to to carry out and to track those events through.0:22:30.830 --&gt; 0:22:30.870Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)M.0:22:26.390 --&gt; 0:22:32.230Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)Now as far as like let's say, once this comes into fruition, do you do you foresee?0:22:33.140 --&gt; 0:22:51.220Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)The tour is its own monster, right? Where where we have five 600 events going through. So from a stress test slash pilot, would you rather maybe not this core team here, but maybe it's like the NBA/NHL where there's like, you know maybe two or three events or like is that how you want to pilot it out?0:22:53.510 --&gt; 0:22:53.790Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)So.0:22:53.710 --&gt; 0:22:53.870Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Hi.0:22:53.350 --&gt; 0:22:56.830Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)To see how basically again to stress test it.0:22:58.310 --&gt; 0:23:0.150Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yeah, Kristen, you're you're going to.0:22:59.520 --&gt; 0:23:20.40Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)No, I was just gonna say I think the biggest piece of that would be we need to make sure those events are going into brandscopic, right? 'cause. There's like, the brandscopic piece of all of the event management pieces, but then that's feeding into the uxp. So I think Lewis, probably from your perspective, this might be different.0:23:21.480 --&gt; 0:23:31.640Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)You when we're doing that testing, we could say at that time like only look for this programme or whatever, but I think it's essential that we start getting that data at least into brandscopic and then.0:23:32.110 --&gt; 0:23:35.790Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)When Uxp is ready, we're gonna. We can approach that.0:23:36.190 --&gt; 0:23:44.990Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)All right. What we can do for at least from our side in order to kind of like build a database is myself, Alex and Paulina can start working on.0:23:50.150 --&gt; 0:23:50.350Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Yeah.0:23:46.750 --&gt; 0:23:52.670Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)Umm. From an export standpoint, export import right? I feel like Seinfeld, the exporter importer.0:23:55.100 --&gt; 0:24:2.940Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)Where we could start bringing that in, just let us know when you want us to turn on that proverbial switch and we can, we can start that process.0:24:3.240 --&gt; 0:24:35.560Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Yeah, I think while Louis is here, so when we're talking about branscopic and then the uxp, so like Alex, even when you say like we wanna see the routing, we wanna see when people have days off like that's all stuff that you would see from the uxp from like a power dashboard extract like that's not brandscopic. That's why we're trying to say like there's these different pieces that go into the uxp and then we need to understand like what are you getting out of that. So when you're saying like the routing of the tours, we really need to understand like what would you?0:24:36.240 --&gt; 0:24:38.80Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Necessarily want to see like what does that mean?0:24:39.290 --&gt; 0:24:42.690Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)So with that, just to answer that question, what that means is that we are.0:24:45.370 --&gt; 0:24:51.610Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)These these individuals are out on the road 24/7 365 more or less right? We need to make sure that we.0:24:52.890 --&gt; 0:24:59.10Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Treat them like the professionals that they are giving them off days, giving them time to travel from point A to point B.0:25:1.490 --&gt; 0:25:15.890Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)We need to call out load insurance and load outs and and all those things in between and the associates need to be able to step back and and look it at at that from above and start to shape and sculpt.0:25:16.790 --&gt; 0:25:31.350Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)That tour schedule, the tour schedule is not like following the rodeo in Texas. It's it's going from the rodeo to the auto show to the home show. Oh wait, the home show's cancelled. Let's go to this thing instead. So it's very winding.0:25:34.180 --&gt; 0:25:34.220Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)M.0:25:32.950 --&gt; 0:25:40.670Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)And challenging that, people don't really understand 'cause it's kind of unique to this this programme. We're not the first tour of momentum, that's for sure, but.0:25:43.490 --&gt; 0:25:46.530Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)I haven't heard of 1 recently. I don't know.0:26:2.970 --&gt; 0:26:3.490Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Most.0:25:48.420 --&gt; 0:26:4.620Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)So what information would be useful and and and and you would need to be able to to to manage all all that routing. How? How? How would that look like, what? What view? What information do you need to be presented to you to be able to organise that?0:26:6.660 --&gt; 0:26:6.780Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Hmm.0:26:8.320 --&gt; 0:26:8.640Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Mm hmm mm.0:26:19.440 --&gt; 0:26:19.640Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yeah.0:26:5.310 --&gt; 0:26:31.110Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)To me, and this is maybe how my brain works to me, is having an air traffic controller view a view that you can step above the granular, like maybe even not even just a week, but the month, the quarter of the year, you need to, you know, step back and allow our associates to say, hey, OK, let's look at the Great Lakes, right, this, this region, we've gone to Chicago.0:26:32.310 --&gt; 0:26:36.510Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)27 times out of 35 weeks, that's too much, right?0:26:49.850 --&gt; 0:26:49.930Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Mm.0:26:37.130 --&gt; 0:26:51.890Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)223 and four, we need to, you know, lean on Indianapolis a little bit more, pull that information. That's a manual thing on that, asking for some sort of analytics, you know, slicer button, but will be interesting and just again be able to make some.0:26:54.760 --&gt; 0:26:56.160Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Quantitative. Qualitative.0:26:56.860 --&gt; 0:26:57.100Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yeah.0:26:57.360 --&gt; 0:26:58.120Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Decisions.0:27:2.140 --&gt; 0:27:3.620Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Yeah, sure.0:26:58.870 --&gt; 0:27:4.830Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)So it's more like retrospectively analyse what has been happening and then be able to, yeah, OK.0:27:4.700 --&gt; 0:27:7.740Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)A little bit. You know, obviously it sometimes in the real time.0:27:8.140 --&gt; 0:27:19.140Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Right. Yeah, yeah, I yeah, I I see. It's just. Yeah. Yeah. No, it makes sense. It's information that would allow you to assess how to perform or organise in a in a more effective way. Yeah. For. Yeah.0:27:22.930 --&gt; 0:27:23.90Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yeah.0:27:29.550 --&gt; 0:27:29.750Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yeah.0:27:32.970 --&gt; 0:27:35.290Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Of course. Yeah. OK, yeah.0:27:20.230 --&gt; 0:27:35.310Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)I I use the the phrase air traffic controller often, but it's also very a good analogy where you need to make sure you land the plane that is in front of you and also care for the ones that are in the queue and hopping down right so it's it's.0:27:39.30 --&gt; 0:27:39.230Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yeah.0:27:38.550 --&gt; 0:27:45.350Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)Yeah, I'm wondering. Sorry and sorry I had to drop for a minute. Umm, when the boss calls, you gotta take it the.0:27:45.370 --&gt; 0:27:45.930Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)I think it's.0:27:47.210 --&gt; 0:28:13.10Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)Maybe this is just repeating what you're saying, Alex, but I think it's finding a way for us to be able to look at something quickly and know something we something we we would need to know that would might take us like a couple like a minute to look into more. Like if you're looking at a sheet, we can see that there's like off days. But are there opportunities to like fill those days or are they travel days or things like that like you want to just be able to quickly look at that?0:28:19.880 --&gt; 0:28:20.80Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yeah.0:28:14.290 --&gt; 0:28:22.370Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)Like and know the information in 10 seconds rather than like digging through a crazy sheet. Or maybe it's even like eventually it's something that's even.0:28:31.720 --&gt; 0:28:32.0Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yeah.0:28:32.580 --&gt; 0:28:32.740Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Yeah.0:28:22.890 --&gt; 0:28:33.370Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)You know if if this is something we're gonna build AI into or anything like that later on that's saying like you have opportunities here because there's no travel over these three weeks, you know, that would be really. That'd be really cool.0:28:36.450 --&gt; 0:28:36.850Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)Next week.0:28:35.160 --&gt; 0:28:40.640Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)At something definitely has been thought of. It's not for version one, but yeah, we have looking into, yeah.0:28:40.0 --&gt; 0:28:41.560Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)Yeah, yeah.0:28:42.360 --&gt; 0:28:47.320Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)What's the different status? Is that the event could have like?0:28:49.280 --&gt; 0:28:52.280Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)When you're tracking something, it's pencilled down. Something is being, yeah.0:28:54.80 --&gt; 0:29:9.320Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)And and and connecting. Sorry to interrupt you and connecting to that you Alex, on your e-mail we're mentioning ability to quickly see missing information such as loading details, activation hours and and how does that relate to to that what you would need, how would you?0:29:10.750 --&gt; 0:29:15.630Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)In in your mind, how would you like to be informed or or or that that's that information is missing?0:29:18.100 --&gt; 0:29:18.220Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Umm.0:29:29.170 --&gt; 0:29:29.370Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yeah.0:29:35.460 --&gt; 0:29:35.900Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Right.0:29:21.470 --&gt; 0:29:50.510Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)So I think the latter part of that question, the load in information, those types of things, that's just a data input field. You know if if we can create it where it says apply all to maybe like a section of events, meaning it's a multi day event that would be interesting, although arguably you only need it for the first and last, even just the first we could make that like a protocol by saying all your logistics information's on the 1st occurrence of the event, we already do that in some respect for some other other.0:29:51.60 --&gt; 0:29:51.860Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Key metrics.0:29:52.150 --&gt; 0:29:52.430Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yeah.0:29:58.670 --&gt; 0:29:58.830Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yeah.0:29:53.660 --&gt; 0:29:59.420Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Your first part of the question was what is it like? What are the various statuses of a specific event?0:30:1.140 --&gt; 0:30:2.220Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)We currently have.0:30:4.200 --&gt; 0:30:8.320Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Two, we have five types of statuses which I kind of hate, but I will go through them.0:30:11.40 --&gt; 0:30:15.400Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)One is proposed, which we've pitched an event to a client.0:30:16.540 --&gt; 0:30:20.140Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Right. The next one is tentative, which.0:30:21.260 --&gt; 0:30:27.900Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Is the client approves it, but we're kind of working through some logistics. I hate that one. I really do hate these.0:30:29.740 --&gt; 0:30:48.340Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)It should just be proposed. It shouldn't be like proposed, tentative and confirmed like I don't know, but whatever. Then we have cancelled, confirmed and and and obviously completed. It's not. It's this is not a sexy like there's nothing to pull from this one. I wish I could give you something more party.0:30:47.930 --&gt; 0:30:53.90Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Is there anything such in progress or do you know when when something or or the moment that?0:30:57.870 --&gt; 0:30:58.30Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yeah.0:30:51.760 --&gt; 0:31:21.680Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Yeah, in progress would in progress is tentative. Basically it's saying like the client likes the auto show and it would be a lot of legwork to get all logistics ironed out ahead of that pitch meeting. So we kind of pitch it with some broad strokes understanding this is like, hey, we there is booth space 10 by 20, there is this on something like that that we know we need. Let us come back to you with some more granular details that's kind of that tentative status.0:31:22.0 --&gt; 0:31:24.240Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Right, OK. I see.0:31:23.720 --&gt; 0:31:30.280Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)Yeah, I'm wondering like and then maybe this is a step too far, like sort of what Alex is saying is like.0:32:0.930 --&gt; 0:32:1.250Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)It's.0:31:31.470 --&gt; 0:32:4.110Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)Sometimes there's an event and it might. There might just be one of them for a weekend. We're looking at. It might be a couple that we're looking at that we're pitching. So some of it is like far out, I'll, I'll call it a ghost route or something where we're like, here's how we see things working while everything's still in progress. Like if there's like a ghost version that's like, this isn't this is like a test system. And then there's like, the real version, like, that gets uploaded into that or or proved, I don't know, like, that's also kind of overthinking it. I think it all 'cause. It's like we only really use that full view.0:32:4.150 --&gt; 0:32:4.750Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)Like really early on.0:32:5.550 --&gt; 0:32:36.990Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)OK. Yeah, it's it's certainly interesting. It has not been considered, but we we can, we can see what can be done. I understand what, what? Yeah, what the purpose of of it is and just going back to to my question about the status and the missing information and so obviously and as I was mentioning earlier, the aim is also to understand how what's useful for you, how would you use it? It's not just OK we get events entry and we can create a calendar, but it's like how do you use it? What information is useful and what I was thinking what I was thinking is like we can colour codes.0:32:37.270 --&gt; 0:33:4.950Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)That is like, you know, if we have a calendar view, we can have different colour codes for meaning a different status for example or we can have visual cues that alert you that there is some information missing. We can determine what's mandatory information that has not been, you know, supplied and and we can provide things like that on a on on some sort of dashboard or your main view. So it it helps you straight away identifying what, yeah, what's in track or what, what you need to action.0:33:5.440 --&gt; 0:33:5.880Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)It.0:33:5.320 --&gt; 0:33:8.280Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Lewis, have you seen the current calendar view? Sorry, go ahead, Eric.0:33:9.770 --&gt; 0:33:14.490Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)I'm not sure I have seen yours. I've seen some, but I don't think I've seen yours.0:33:16.170 --&gt; 0:33:18.530Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)Yeah. Well, I assume Alex's points on that, why he's doing that.0:33:20.210 --&gt; 0:33:20.290Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Mm.0:33:21.40 --&gt; 0:33:26.160Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)Oh, never mind. I blanked on it. Sorry we missed it. We missed the opportunity. It was good.0:33:26.900 --&gt; 0:33:27.100Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Mm hmm.0:33:25.680 --&gt; 0:33:29.40Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Oh, man. Sorry, Eric. Sure was not provoking.0:33:30.740 --&gt; 0:33:31.100Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Bye.0:33:31.730 --&gt; 0:33:36.930Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)So your last comment about colour coding and status changes in those things.0:33:37.330 --&gt; 0:33:37.570Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yeah.0:33:44.980 --&gt; 0:33:45.20Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)M.0:33:38.10 --&gt; 0:33:55.530Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Again, putting it in the context of Verizon at large, there's many different. This is crazy within itself, right? But there's many different programmes going on, so analytics sees this as like, all right, so this like kind of like Nantucket red as we call it, is for the.0:33:56.180 --&gt; 0:34:17.660Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Atlantic N This light's light Blues for the the mountain region, so I just I would caution by using like a blanket green as like an event confirmed just because you can't further slice it. I don't know. This is like a nothing comment, but something to be aware of. Plus I guarantee you there is a piece of information, maybe not critical.0:34:19.340 --&gt; 0:34:20.860Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Missing for every one of these events.0:34:21.800 --&gt; 0:34:22.120Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Right.0:34:23.810 --&gt; 0:34:37.730Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)It's no, it's. It's definitely useful information. I I get what you're saying and doesn't need to be colour coding. I mean we we can use different visual cues for meaning different, you know, different regions, different statuses.0:34:39.210 --&gt; 0:35:1.770Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Information missing and we can do stuff like provide additional information when you are, you know just dropping your mouse over. We can show you know what start and date events or information. It's not shown straight away. We can. Yeah. Understand what what's what's important and exactly like like you're clicking here we can have it in a glance.0:35:2.450 --&gt; 0:35:8.130Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Who is involved? Who is own? Who is the owner, who is has been assigned? Also anybody who's got.0:35:9.650 --&gt; 0:35:16.770Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)If we can assign users, we can read AD so we can associate the profile of the person that has been assigned.0:35:18.610 --&gt; 0:35:27.410Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)And see the roles that have been assigned and then just then you know sort of the person and see what are all the events that are that person has been included and and stuff like that.0:35:33.340 --&gt; 0:35:33.620Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Ha ha.0:35:28.210 --&gt; 0:35:40.610Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)How can we be helpful for you today? 'cause? I know we could talk capabilities, you know, till till wit's end. But what information questions you have for us that we would be helpful in designing?0:35:44.740 --&gt; 0:35:45.140Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Sure.0:35:39.180 --&gt; 0:36:8.340Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)You have been helpful so far. It's it's more like and and the idea of this is just to be a bit of a conversation and it's understand not not only asking the questions of things that I can come up with, but also hearing you talking about the events or stuff that has not been considered. How would you, you know, use the platform as as when as I was mentioning what's useful for you, what what fields or information you're capturing that probably are not capturing can not being captured in, in for all the clients.0:36:10.950 --&gt; 0:36:25.710Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yeah. What? What do you report at the end of the day, it's it's. It's a bit understanding a bit the the account and yeah. How you go about it. And so for example also going all the all the way back to the beginning.0:36:27.190 --&gt; 0:36:45.990Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)It's even it needs to determine the hierarchy on the system. Would you know first about the campaign and then create events? Or are the events created 1st and then are assigned it assigned to a campaign? What what's the right order in which that this happens?0:36:46.890 --&gt; 0:36:52.610Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)It's if I'm understanding your question correctly, it's almost always going to be campaign and then events.0:36:53.80 --&gt; 0:36:53.480Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Right.0:36:56.440 --&gt; 0:36:56.840Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Right.0:36:58.920 --&gt; 0:36:59.600Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yes.0:36:53.730 --&gt; 0:37:1.730Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Because you have to bill it somewhere, right? You can't just say I want to go to the auto show. You need to make sure that the local programme is going to the auto show.0:37:12.470 --&gt; 0:37:12.670Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Yeah.0:37:2.250 --&gt; 0:37:16.530Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Right. OK. Yeah. OK. Yeah. It's just it's not necessarily every everybody, not all the clients build against the campaign and in in the sense that there could be, yeah a A yeah sub projects or yeah. OK.0:37:33.230 --&gt; 0:37:33.310Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Mm.0:37:18.360 --&gt; 0:37:48.360Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)I've gone back, I remembered what I was gonna say. We were talking about load in loadout information, and like, hovering over the first date and last date. What what we were thinking about like, I think in 2019 when we were attempting to overhaul the current the system we were on at the time was like if a if an event is attached to each other, can we set up an automatic like it shoots it into like a two page PDF or one version of it? That's a call sheet, so to speak, where it's like this is all your event details on one page or two pages 'cause then it's like.0:37:49.120 --&gt; 0:37:51.240Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)Either that goes to the client and our team or.0:37:52.510 --&gt; 0:38:2.950Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)If it is truly just using the system, that's OK too, and maybe it is hovering, but I don't know. I was just thinking if there's any automated way of doing like call sheets and such.0:38:3.440 --&gt; 0:38:3.960Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Well.0:38:5.110 --&gt; 0:38:34.910Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)It hasn't been scored, but there is something that certainly could could be looked at if if that's something that would be useful for you and and and it's things like that. I was talking if if you're telling me. Yeah, that's great. But, you know, aside of that, I'll I have to go and take a screenshot or or, you know, extract that information and and supply it. So that's great to understand. We could look into. Yeah, extracting what information we'll have to determine what are the fields. Yeah. Which of the fields are to be extracted because if we are tracking there. Yeah.0:38:40.490 --&gt; 0:38:40.810Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)Yeah.0:38:35.310 --&gt; 0:38:56.670Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Be some of the information. It's not not relevant, not in scope for whatever purposes. So if you could least you know that type of conversions what we need or actually we need to extract because one is for clients, one is for peel people. So they've got a list of stuff would be, yeah, great because you've got the yeah, the understanding and.0:39:1.290 --&gt; 0:39:1.650Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)OK.0:38:57.310 --&gt; 0:39:14.790Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)The and that I don't about about how that works, so it would help me a lot if if you could just yeah, write it down and list it and say that would be the the type of files and that's the purpose. That's how we usually share it or how it would be shared and and that's the data we would like to to include. We can look into that.0:39:14.470 --&gt; 0:39:19.510Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)OK, OK. Yeah. I don't see it as a priority. It was just more of like an enhancement long term maybe.0:39:22.310 --&gt; 0:39:26.30Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)I'm sorry again. Like I don't know what you all were kind of already discussed.0:39:28.400 --&gt; 0:39:30.0Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)So when we were talking about like.0:39:31.480 --&gt; 0:39:47.280Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)A system up front to upload events and do other things in a in a management system of sorts for it. Are we thinking that this will be brandscopic leading into a bigger system or obviously we're working in brandscopic for now or will be and eventually we'll have a proprietary system.0:39:50.720 --&gt; 0:39:53.200Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)The idea is that, yeah, go. Go ahead, Chris.0:39:50.630 --&gt; 0:40:7.150Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)It would be Oh yeah, it would be initially brandscopic for now. So we're gonna get used to what fields we need to ask. We still need to do that work to streamline, like the fields, the recap questions, all of that.0:40:7.430 --&gt; 0:40:7.510Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)Mm.0:40:8.390 --&gt; 0:40:24.670Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)In the future, it'll be you entering the event, scheduling details in the uxp and then the only purpose of branscopic then would be field managers, brain ambassadors recapping in brandiscopic.0:40:25.410 --&gt; 0:40:25.850Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)OK.0:40:26.240 --&gt; 0:40:40.80Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)What we're doing, though, is the transition between like scheduling and brain scopic now it won't be a huge change once we're actually doing that in the uxp instead.0:40:41.280 --&gt; 0:40:44.680Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)So it's not like we're doing double the work, we really just need to like.0:40:46.120 --&gt; 0:40:57.40Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Figure out all the fields that we need right now and then get used to entering those somewhere. So brandscopic for now for scheduling uxp in the future for scheduling.0:40:58.560 --&gt; 0:41:4.240Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Brian's got book would still remain for the brand ambassador recapping data.0:41:7.520 --&gt; 0:41:14.80Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)Good to know 'cause I had some things that will most definitely just fall on brands copy, so there's no point in asking about it now. Umm.0:41:13.680 --&gt; 0:41:14.80Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Yeah.0:41:15.790 --&gt; 0:41:23.710Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)Some things like that would fall into maybe our back end system that we would do is something that I've wanted to do for years was inventory management.0:41:24.300 --&gt; 0:41:24.380Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Mm.0:41:25.210 --&gt; 0:41:39.130Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)Is that something where we know in our system there were 10,000 key chains and we said we gave away 300 at an event that on the our system and knows that it's just continuingly backing out the inventory.0:41:40.200 --&gt; 0:42:10.480Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Right. So inventory management has not been as as in in the scope of the UXP, but I know that some other team has mentioned having something or being looking into inventory management systems. So an option here and that's part of the next question is yeah, what other integrations would be required? So if there is a system that captures that information, we could integrate it and and provide that information centralised that information and connect it. So you can do.0:42:10.760 --&gt; 0:42:21.0Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)That manipulation or or entering the the details on that all the platform but being able to retrieve it and centralised it through through the XP and through the reporting.0:42:21.610 --&gt; 0:42:22.90Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)OK.0:42:23.990 --&gt; 0:42:26.350Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)Alright, I won't hijack anymore. Y'all, can you?0:42:27.340 --&gt; 0:42:34.180Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)No, I think on that note like are there any other integrations like we obviously know QR codes? Umm.0:42:34.120 --&gt; 0:42:34.320Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)Mm hmm.0:42:37.110 --&gt; 0:42:51.870Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)I know sometimes we have a photo op then like that kinda gets in murky waters 'cause. We would do different vendors, but is there anything else you guys could think of that would be data that you'd want to relate back and join in the uxp?0:42:52.940 --&gt; 0:42:53.780Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)I get I mean.0:42:54.820 --&gt; 0:43:14.100Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)Instead of I don't wanna use the word bother, but like when we do URL creations most of it's coming from the same common back end and it's just like a new suffix. So would it be who was just like AQR code can get created? Could a URL based off of certain parameters get created as well and free up some of like Hunter's time?0:43:16.950 --&gt; 0:43:18.910Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)Wah Wah Wah Wah OK.0:43:14.900 --&gt; 0:43:23.940Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)That could not, unfortunately. There's too many variables and what we have to set up for common back end.0:43:25.320 --&gt; 0:43:26.800Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)I think though.0:43:26.710 --&gt; 0:43:27.830Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)A boy can dream.0:43:28.460 --&gt; 0:43:35.420Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Yeah. No, I think it's a good note to look at the common back end in at least figure out how we could.0:43:36.820 --&gt; 0:43:45.60Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Take the data that we're collecting there because we would know what URL is used based off the QR code creation.0:43:53.350 --&gt; 0:43:53.710Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)Right.0:43:46.520 --&gt; 0:43:59.640Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)So I think that's a good note for us. 'cause it at least we could get that data post event, but I don't we wouldn't be able to create the URLs. There's too many parameters.0:43:59.910 --&gt; 0:44:0.230Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Yeah.0:44:3.220 --&gt; 0:44:21.980Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Small small thing, but adding site maps would be nice. Like if you can attach files to a line item. Sometimes we have Ba talking points that are different. We have site maps and those types of things which would be helpful to to Eric's point, compile and send out as A1 cheater. That would be great.0:44:22.940 --&gt; 0:44:23.260Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Mm hmm mm.0:44:23.470 --&gt; 0:44:40.230Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)You can what would be awesome as well is to affix QR codes to as just like an attachment, but almost like a like a call out by saying, hey, this is your Northern star for like KPIs like this is your QR code, right?0:44:40.560 --&gt; 0:44:40.680Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Hmm.0:44:41.990 --&gt; 0:44:57.990Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)And then you can attach that to either a programme or a specific event, because there's programme QR codes that are for what we work on right for the whole tour, it's not gonna change. And then there's one off QR codes that are for out of scope events or something unique so.0:44:58.430 --&gt; 0:45:2.470Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Being able to differentiate or quickly select all versus some.0:45:8.670 --&gt; 0:45:14.630Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)I have a note on here. Do you use it or? Excuse me, Qualtrics, do you use that anymore?0:45:15.850 --&gt; 0:45:16.290Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)Wow.0:45:16.680 --&gt; 0:45:19.600Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)I've heard that name in awhile. What is that I'm trying to remember?0:45:17.910 --&gt; 0:45:20.350Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)I know, I guess not.0:45:21.270 --&gt; 0:45:22.430Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)No Qualtrics.0:45:24.770 --&gt; 0:45:26.930Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)What was that, Joe? Why does that sound familiar?0:45:30.710 --&gt; 0:45:32.710Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Qualtrics is all the surveying, right?0:45:33.470 --&gt; 0:45:35.190Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Oh, that's what it is. It was like.0:45:34.370 --&gt; 0:45:36.370Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Like through uh, Lisa's team.0:45:36.100 --&gt; 0:45:38.860Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)Yeah, Lisa's team. We do still do surveys.0:45:39.450 --&gt; 0:45:40.810Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Just not always.0:45:41.100 --&gt; 0:45:42.340Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)Not always, it's.0:45:43.130 --&gt; 0:45:44.770Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)I really work Qualtrics, that's why.0:45:43.690 --&gt; 0:45:47.770Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)It's been sunsetted a lot for the sports portfolio.0:45:48.520 --&gt; 0:45:48.720Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Uh huh.0:45:50.310 --&gt; 0:45:56.110Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)I don't know what their take is on from a local standpoint right now. We're still doing it. It's.0:45:56.890 --&gt; 0:45:58.770Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Yeah, I don't think it's gonna go away.0:45:57.740 --&gt; 0:46:0.660Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)There's no stand, there's no standardisation yet, really.0:46:1.230 --&gt; 0:46:1.870Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)OK.0:46:3.30 --&gt; 0:46:9.190Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)So Kristen, there is, I think there's gonna be a need in the future for surveys to be a a part of, like the programme.0:46:10.760 --&gt; 0:46:13.560Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)You know, whatever you know, call outs but.0:46:16.40 --&gt; 0:46:16.800Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)I mean, that's it.0:46:16.380 --&gt; 0:46:21.340Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)Why you think Kristen is a way to integrate that? Or is that still gonna have to be like a separate entity?0:46:23.270 --&gt; 0:46:31.590Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)It would be separate, but we're just trying to get to like every possible separate data point that we need to join back.0:46:32.820 --&gt; 0:46:41.20Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)Yeah, I mean, like I don't. I mean if there is an API or anything I can set up between the that system in ours, I mean obviously that would be useful.0:46:42.580 --&gt; 0:46:47.180Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)I don't know if we're still using that company though. Pauline, what's the app we use on the tablet?0:46:49.820 --&gt; 0:46:50.260Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)OK.0:46:51.320 --&gt; 0:46:51.840Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Waltrix.0:46:51.440 --&gt; 0:46:52.240Rubin, Paulina (NYC-MOM)Quadratics.0:46:53.190 --&gt; 0:46:53.870Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)Dratix.0:46:55.180 --&gt; 0:46:55.900Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Ball tricks.0:46:55.270 --&gt; 0:46:56.750Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)Did you just make up a word?0:46:56.460 --&gt; 0:46:58.900Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)They they rebranded.0:46:57.910 --&gt; 0:47:0.990Rubin, Paulina (NYC-MOM)No, I think that's what it's called. Like the survey, it's like a queue.0:47:1.480 --&gt; 0:47:2.200Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Ball tricks.0:47:1.610 --&gt; 0:47:7.850Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)Yeah, that's who's. That's who's receiving the data. So I don't know what it, if it goes through another system, maybe that's just a conversation for Lisa.0:47:10.240 --&gt; 0:47:21.0Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)But also it's the question of like do we want just the data that I mean I guess it needs to be attached to an event. So I guess as long as it's flowing in there, I think that's worth it. And then if it like long term, if it can then?0:47:22.30 --&gt; 0:47:24.390Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)Do some measurement on it even better.0:47:24.180 --&gt; 0:47:25.660Mannarino, Joe (NYC-MOM)Oh no. We're still using Qualtrics.0:47:26.520 --&gt; 0:47:26.840Rubin, Paulina (NYC-MOM)Yeah.0:47:26.440 --&gt; 0:47:31.280Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)OK. So it's just a system that's intaking and then sending it to that, it sounds like.0:47:33.140 --&gt; 0:47:49.100Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)Yeah. I mean, since we're talking about this like, I just had a conversation with the clients two days ago about like what things they want to see. Like, I'm trying to change our how quickly we're re report 'cause right now. We're not giving them anything until like Wednesday evening, which is ridiculous.0:47:50.280 --&gt; 0:47:51.400Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)They've given us like.0:48:3.0 --&gt; 0:48:3.280Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Mm hmm mm.0:47:53.230 --&gt; 0:48:13.30Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)Four or five things that they absolutely wanna see as soon as possible, and I think most of these can be are done, can be done through an API. So like the first thing, it sounds like scans would be QR codes like can QR tiger push out via API and newer into either brandscopic or a reporting system.0:48:15.0 --&gt; 0:48:16.200Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yes it can.0:48:16.900 --&gt; 0:48:17.460Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)OK.0:48:17.240 --&gt; 0:48:20.840Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Well, at the moment. So at the moment how how it's done?0:48:22.240 --&gt; 0:48:27.280Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Through the data team there is a bit of schedule every 24 hours, it's refreshed and pools all the.0:48:29.140 --&gt; 0:48:30.980Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)I think all all the scans for all the QR codes.0:48:31.760 --&gt; 0:48:39.800Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)OK, cool. The next thing would be leads, and that is two different things. That's obviously that's loop calls and e-mail capture.0:48:41.240 --&gt; 0:48:49.760Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)I think only one of them's done via Studio Labs and the other one is still, I think running on that other company are both of those set up to be AP is.0:48:51.530 --&gt; 0:48:57.130Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)Because when I talk to you think she's like, oh, our team has to go in and look at the list and do a count. And like, why?0:48:59.460 --&gt; 0:49:0.140Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Yeah.0:48:59.210 --&gt; 0:49:21.410Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)It is kind of funky, like we're capturing the information there still needs to be a little bit of manipulation because what if you land and don't fill out the form completely? What if it's a duplicate person like I think that's the funky things that sometimes that's why they're like, oh, we have to go look at it and pull it.0:49:22.80 --&gt; 0:49:39.280Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)I'm wondering if there's two things with that where where we can preface that where it's like the number that is pulled into the system on Monday is the unclean number. You will then continue to see the you'll get a report from us with us reviewing it and everything else with the updated numbers on another day.0:49:48.860 --&gt; 0:49:49.140Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Yeah.0:49:41.40 --&gt; 0:49:49.280Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)I'm also like very aware that the way they're doing it is they're they have access to PII, which like, makes a whole bunch of people uncomfortable. So.0:49:50.440 --&gt; 0:49:53.640Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)That's the only reason why I was like, is there another way of doing this without?0:49:55.250 --&gt; 0:50:6.370Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)Even if, like I guess the question is like if there are dupes, how much do we care and incompletes, is there a better way of showing that so it doesn't register as a complete I suppose?0:50:8.90 --&gt; 0:50:11.210Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)I just know I don't like that they're going in and looking at their information.0:50:7.890 --&gt; 0:50:18.970Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Yeah, I think all possible. We just. Yeah, I think all possible. We just like, this is the exact conversation we need to have to solve for that.0:50:19.500 --&gt; 0:50:24.180Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)OK. 'cause. That's like the clients want this at like Monday at like 1.0:50:25.910 --&gt; 0:50:25.950Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Hmm.0:50:28.450 --&gt; 0:50:28.650Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Mm hmm.0:50:28.730 --&gt; 0:50:53.50Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)It's something that the we're like, hey, the number was 300, but you know, it's already prefaced that we haven't cleaned these numbers yet. This is just what it is. Like they're OK with that. They just want to kind of they want to have, like a benchmark on like or an idea of how we did on the weekend, cuz if the number is 300 and then all of a sudden we clean it, it's like 100. Like, we have bigger issues, but if it drops by like 15, you're like, OK.0:50:57.320 --&gt; 0:51:6.360Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)The other stuff I think is I don't like. I don't really know how we're we need to refinish out how we calculate engagements 'cause they don't like that. So that's not an apii don't think that's more.0:51:7.720 --&gt; 0:51:12.880Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)Something we have to do internally. Sales is the same thing. That's not something that could be an API that is manually input.0:51:14.440 --&gt; 0:51:17.200Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)And that's it. That's what they want right away.0:51:22.510 --&gt; 0:51:22.750Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)Right.0:51:23.780 --&gt; 0:51:30.180Alden, Erik (NYC-MOM)Those are the only external systems I can think of that would be QR, tiger, and whatever leads we're getting from the different systems.0:51:35.760 --&gt; 0:51:42.520Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)OK, I think Louis, this gives us a great.0:51:42.560 --&gt; 0:51:43.240Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Starting point.0:51:43.840 --&gt; 0:51:44.920Bustos, Luis (WW-MOM)It does, yes.0:51:45.520 --&gt; 0:51:55.200Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)I I think I still have your smartsheet that you were showing Alex, do you have an example of the client view that you share?0:51:55.890 --&gt; 0:51:56.450Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Sure thing.0:51:58.60 --&gt; 0:52:0.420Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Let me just double check that I have the smartsheet.0:52:2.700 --&gt; 0:52:5.100Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Right, gives you access to this. This isn't crazy.0:52:6.480 --&gt; 0:52:6.920Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)It.0:52:9.20 --&gt; 0:52:12.60Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Really the same thing as smartsheets, but I'll show it to you now.0:52:16.300 --&gt; 0:52:16.460Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Nah.0:52:22.400 --&gt; 0:52:32.680Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)And is it true that everything that's showing up here would be confirmed? Oh, no. I saw the status. Do you have, like, in progress things too?0:52:34.170 --&gt; 0:52:36.570Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Proposed. OK.0:52:33.490 --&gt; 0:52:44.130Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Yeah, like proposed is a big one. You know it it kind of gives the client some understanding of what's downstream, what's gonna happen in the future, so that they they see things.0:52:45.610 --&gt; 0:52:49.170Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)I don't think that. Yeah, so tentative dropped off. It's just proposed.0:52:52.290 --&gt; 0:52:56.770Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)I'm I requested access. I don't who has the access.0:52:56.650 --&gt; 0:52:57.330Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Oh, OK.0:52:58.540 --&gt; 0:52:58.740Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Yeah.0:53:4.370 --&gt; 0:53:9.930Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)You're gonna ask what the difference between red and black is, and I don't know that offhand.0:53:12.540 --&gt; 0:53:13.900Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Makes it flashier.0:53:16.300 --&gt; 0:53:23.100Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)That's true. Oh, this is probably things that Verizon is entering.0:53:24.440 --&gt; 0:53:24.800Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Is in red.0:53:26.300 --&gt; 0:53:32.540Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Although these two make it confusing to me, these three, these three shouldn't be on Verizon.0:53:36.210 --&gt; 0:53:37.410Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)See if that's the same for.0:53:38.600 --&gt; 0:53:38.960Tarlow, Alex (NYC-MOM)Someone.0:53:36.720 --&gt; 0:53:44.600Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)OK. And then the other piece for Brandscopic specifically, Eric and Joe.0:53:46.0 --&gt; 0:53:49.760Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Have you guys been looking at like the actual scheduling?0:53:51.150 --&gt; 0:53:54.510Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)Fields and recapping that we talked about.0:53:55.810 --&gt; 0:54:6.890Baum, Kristen (STL-MOM)If not, it's OK.
