Attach files such as site maps and BA talking points to the events and generate call sheets.Colour-code the events by status and region and alert the user of any missing information.Integrate with the survey platform and provide the data on scans, leads, sales, and engagements as soon as possible.Top of FormErik’s raised requirements:Scan data and the leads data from the QR codes and the common back end as soon as possible after the events.Change the reporting cadence and provide the client with some key metrics such as scans, leads, engagements, and sales on Monday at 1 pm.Avoid having to manually clean the data from the different systems.Have an inventory management system that can track the number of key chains and other premiums that are given away at the events.Requirements table:Overarching ThemeCategoryItemRequesterMVPv1+Other platformComplexityData ManagementData CollectionIntake form for capturing client informationAlex✓MediumData IntegrationStreamline data collection from various sourcesAlex✓HighData ReportingProvide key metrics report by Monday at 1 pmErik✓MediumData CleaningAvoid manual data cleaning from different systemsErik✓MediumUI/UXEvent VisualizationCalendar view of events with colour codesJoe✓MediumColour-code events by status and regionAlex✓LowQR CodesCreate and attach QR codes to eventsJoe✓MediumAutomatically create QR codes and URLs for eventsAlex✓MediumTour ScheduleAir traffic controller view of tour scheduleAlex✓HighOperational EfficiencyManual Work ReductionReduce manual work in creating estimates and rate cardsAlex✓HighCost EstimationSimplify process of estimating cost for physical assetsJoe✓MediumInventory TrackingTrack inventory of premiums and assetsJoe✓HighInventory ManagementTrack giveaways and premiums at eventsErik✓HighDocumentation &amp; Lead ManagementDocumentationAttach files to events and compile into call sheetJoe✓MediumLead CaptureCapture and report leads from loop calls and emailJoe✓MediumRate Card &amp; EstimatesAutomatically generate rate card and estimates from intake formJoe✓HighInventoryInventory ManagementTrack giveaways and premiums at eventsErik✓HighEvent Status:Proposed: The event has been pitched to the client but not yet approved.Tentative: The client has approved the event but the logistics are still being worked out.Confirmed: The event has been finalised and is ready to be executed.Cancelled: The event has been cancelled for some reason.Completed: The event has been executed and reported.Current Tool kit routingIn Google Sheets:In SmartsheetLuis’ questions:What does the client request look like? Is it completely formulated once? Once they, they request us some work? Or is it a heads-up originally and that's been shaped as the weeks progress? Or how does it work?Alex answered that for in-scope events, they have a good cadence of planning and selecting the events, but for out-of-scope events, they are haphazardly collecting the information and they would benefit from an intake form that can compile and estimate the information.In which format do currently rate cars exist? Is that spreadsheet or are there in in vantage in theory?Joe answered that they have a rate card for people, but they are trying to simplify the process of estimating the cost of physical assets by having a ballpark price and a drop-down menu.Email from Alex with responses before meeting:What tools or methods are currently used for tracking events SmartSheets – used mainly by BL and Analytics to compile event details for both scheduling and reportingGoogle Sheets – used internally and externally for organization and Verizon tracking (ie Master Routing Doc)Who are the key stakeholders involved in the event planningScheduler – all BLsEvent Details – BL + XPBA or Staffing  - BLRecap data – Analytics + BLEvent MetricsWhat data is reported to clientVenue, Zip Code, Region, Activation Type, Event Type, Vertical, Attendance, Impressions, LQA, LQS, Surveys, QR Scans, Premiums, Sales, Lead Gen, Activation DaysHow is data collected from eventsSales, Premiums Distributed = reported by Field Managers to BLs for input into weekly Analytics reportVenue, Zip, Region, Activation Type, Event Type, Vertical, Attendance = inputted by BL into SmartSheetsLQA, LQS, Surveys, QR Scans, Lead Gen = compiled by AnalyticsWhat is challenging in your processEnsuring data points needed by other teams (Analytics, XP) are collected and inputted before reports are pulledIntegrations that exist, if applicableUnsure what this question is askingFeatures and Functionality: What features do you think would streamline the event planning and tracking process for you? Ensuring any solution allows for an ‘air traffic controller’ view – a view that shows all events across multiple regions/event types to see quickly:1) routing for tours makes sense2) event proposals – ie, where do BL associates see the tour going next3) ability to quickly see missing information such as load-in details, activation hours, etc.Are there specific functionalities that you consider essential for your role managing events? A grid-like view of all events. A calendar view does not suffice and quickly gets messy if it cuts off event details. Seeing only event names does not allow BL to see potential routing issues.ToolsSmartsheetsCalendarReportingClients sometimes ask for google sheetsWhat is being shared?Powerpoint recapsTracking eventsDOTMapsCalendarBLXPThey do not use Project ManagersOr creative or XPThey use sponsorship or much of other requirementsAll that data Pain points:Multiple entry pointsROI formEvent TypesMany different eventsDifferent type of data and categories they need info onWG&amp;S Client-SideBrand  SVP/VPs/ManagersLocal/Regional (Field)Brand Ambassadors (persons who are the "face" of each Brand for WG&amp;S)Commercial &amp; Sales TeamLuxury Specialists Global Team (minimal interaction, mainly for Whiskies)Event Types:Trade EventsLSSMobile Tour / Account Locations (on- and off- premise, and/or National Accounts)Mobile Tour / LSSBrand ActivationsPortfolio ActivationsBrand Sales ProgramApprovalWishlistRemove data supplicationBrief becoming eventCalendar viewPost event docGeneration of automated deckVendorFavorite’s photosMap – where is it atReportingDashboardsEventsNotificationns
